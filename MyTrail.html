<body><p>I find it very easy to misread numbers  and even though it was just four options for most of the variables so was it very hard get a quick grasp of it and you really had to focus and read to find what a country found the most important. So that&#39;s how I&#39;ve chosen to focus my visualaiton, what each country has as the largest group for the given variable and year.</p>
<p>To set this you use the dropdown in the lower left of the visualisation and pick what you want to see, then wait a few seconds as the visualisations crouches through it&#39;s 8k hexagons and change the colours. </p>
